        "K-means se utiliza para agrupar documentos según su similitud en términos de frecuencia de términos, mientras que LDA y LSI se utilizan para extraer información de tópicos y semántica latente de grandes conjuntos de datos de texto. K-means es rápido y fácil de implementar, pero requiere un número previo de grupos, mientras que LDA y LSI son útiles para descubrir patrones latentes en grandes conjuntos de datos, pero pueden ser computacionalmente costosos y pueden perder información importante debido a la reducción de dimensionalidad."
